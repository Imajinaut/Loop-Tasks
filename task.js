// 1. Declare a variable using `let` and assign it a string value. Then, use `console.log()` to print its type using the `typeof` operator.


let myVariable = `Great is God`
console.log(typeof(myVariable))



// 2. Create two number variables using `const` and add them together. Store the result in a new variable using `let`.

const firstNum = 23
const secondNum = 30
let total = firstNum+secondNum
console.log(total)





// 3. Declare a boolean variable and an array. Use `console.log()` to print the type of each.

let myName = true
let myArray = [
    firstPerson={
        name:James,
        class: Jss2,
    },
    secondPerson={
        name:James,
        class: Jss2
    }
];


// 4. Create an object with at least three properties of different types (string, number, boolean). Use `console.log()` to print the entire object.
let myObject= {
     james: true,
     ourNum: 23,
     myNames: `James Jackson`
}
console.log(myObject)



// 5. Write a simple expression that uses arithmetic operators to calculate the area of a rectangle. Use `let` to declare the length and width variables.

// (b*h)
let base = 5
let height = 4
let areaOfRectangle = base*height

// 6. Create a string variable and a number variable. Use the addition operator to concatenate them and log the result. What is the type of the result?

let myString = `Ajayi`
let newNum = 123
let addMe = myString + newNum


// 7. Declare three variables: one with `let`, one with `const`, and one with `var`. Attempt to reassign each of them and observe the differences in behavior.



// 8. Write an expression that uses comparison operators to check if a number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Use `console.log()` to print the result.



// 9. Create an array of mixed data types (string, number, boolean). Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the type of each element using `typeof`.



// 10. Write a function that takes two parameters and uses logical operators to determine if both parameters are truthy. Return the result and test your function with different combinations of values.
